Welcome to the Llais y Brân plugins for [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/), the Eurorack simulator. In case you were wondering, "Llais y Brân" is Welsh for "the Crow's Voice."
These plugins were written by Jim Finnis, a [lecturer in Computer Science](https://users.aber.ac.uk/jcf12/) at Aberystwyth University.
This work has absolutely nothing to do with my work there!

Current plugins are:
* **Lliw**, a very simple chord generator
* **Lliw 2**, a more complex version which has a fixed number of output channels but can fade them up and down
* **Octave Limiter** for keeping algorithmically generated 1V/oct pitches in the same octave(s)
* **Poly Select** for selecting a single mono channel from a poly signal with a CV
