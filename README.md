# Llais y Brân

Welcome to the Llais y Brân plugin page. In case you were wondering, "Llais y Brân" is Welsh for "the Crow's Voice."
These plugins were written by Jim Finnis, a [lecturer in Computer Science](https://users.aber.ac.uk/jcf12/) at Aberystwyth University.
This work has absolutely nothing to do with my work there!
